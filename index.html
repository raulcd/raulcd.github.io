        <div class="date-time-title">Tuesday, March 17, 2015</div>
        While reading an email at the Python developers mailing list about PEP-488 (which is not yet approved and is under discussion) I wondered how bytecode files works in Python.
The purpose of this post is to take some notes for myself and share what I find.
PEP-3147 While I was reading the proposed PEP-488 (which will be explained later) there was several references to PEP-3147.
Before PEP-3147 was implemented, files were saved with the format '{filename}.

        While doing performance testing on a project I needed to process the access logs of our web servers to define the navigation profile of our current users.
So I though it would be a nice time to play with Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana as I&rsquo;ve heard of the stack.
ELK Stack The first thing to notice when using it is how easy to use is. It took me a couple of hours since I decided to use it to have a prototype working on my local host.

        This website has been created using pelican. Pelican is static site generator written in Python.
Basically the needs for the project were:
 Easy deployment and mantainance Write articles using Markdown Code syntax highlighting  After a quick research in order to select the framework to use in order to keep things simple, Pelican had all the features needed.
Generation of website Pelican is really easy to start with. You just need to create your project and install pelican:
